# Titanic-EDA
### Titanic EDA and Machine Learning Prep

I Performed exploratory data analysis on a dataset about the Titanic. I replaced the embarkation abbreviations with their corresponding location names. For numerical columns with null values, I filled them with the mean, and for categorical columns with null values, I used the mode.

I conducted summary statistics, including univariate analysis to examine the distribution and characteristics of individual variables, bivariate analysis to explore the relationships between predictor variables and the target variable (survived), and multivariate analysis using a correlation matrix to understand how all the features are interrelated. Additionally, I applied one-hot encoding to the categorical features to prepare the dataset for machine learning.
